 8) Two commands that would add information of minor value
 o ethtool. uses ioctl but does not follow same pattern as ifconfig seems
    to use
  - ethtool -i <dev> gives driver information including firmware-version
  - ethtool -S <dev> gives some statistics on rx/tx
 and udevadm (does what hardware.py does)
 11) tried NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY, setting _WIPHY_TX_POWER_LEVEL but did
  not return the current power level - currently cannot find anything in nl80211.h
  that could be used to get tx power
 17) distro tests
  o openSUSE
  o RedHat/Fedora
  o Debian (g2g)
  o Arch
  o CentOs (?)
  o slackware
  o dd-wrt/OpenWRT
 21) look at NL80211_CMD_START_AP - no need to try and recreate the wheel by
  replicate hostap but could be useful
 26) need to parse dumps NLM_F_DUMP, for now we're good with link etc, so long
   as the card is connected but it may come up eventually
 29) figure out how to parse the information element in pyw.link - there's some
   good shit in it including sometimes the router os and type
   o in link, NL80211_BSS_BEACON_IES vs NL80211_BSS_INFORMATION_ELEMENT
     BEACON_IES may not always be presenet but appears to contain more
 31) add VHT processing to sta_info bitrate
 39) parsing wiphy_bands (should we add the below?)
   o _HT_MCS_SET: a 16-bit attr containing the MCS set as defined in 802.11n
   o _HT_CAPA: as in the HT information IE
 42) is there a simple way to set the format strings as constants keeping in
   mind that things like strings require a length in the format string
 45) find out if some of the 'flags' for bands are actually correct such as
   HT40+ which should be disabled for channel 11
 46) max-tx for bands is showing 15 when iwconfig shows 30
