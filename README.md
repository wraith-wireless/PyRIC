## 1 DESCRIPTION:
PyRIC (is a Linux only) library providing wireless developers and pentesters the
ability to identify, enumerate and manipulate their system's wireless cards
programmatically in Python. Pentesting applications and scripts written in Python
have increased dramatically in recent years. However, these tools still rely on
Linux command lines tools to setup and prepare and restore the system for use.
Until now. Why use subprocess.Popen, regular expressions and str.find to interact
with your wireless cards? PyRIC is:

1. Pythonic: no ctypes, SWIG etc. PyRIC redefines C header files as Python and
uses sockets to communicate with the kernel.
2. Self-sufficient: No third-party files used. PyRIC is completely self-contained.
3. Fast: (relatively speaking) PyRIC is faster than using command line tools
through subprocess.Popen
4. Parseless: Get the output you want without parsing output from command line
tools. Never worry about newer iw versions and having to rewrite your parsers.
5. Easy: If you can use iw, you can use PyRIC.

At it's heart, PyRIC is a Python port of (a subset of) iw and by extension, a
Python port of Netlink w.r.t nl80211 functionality. The original goal of PyRIC
was to provide a simple interface to the underlying nl80211 kernel support,
handling the complex operations of Netlink seamlessy while maintaining a minimum
of "code walking" to understand, modify and extend. But, why stop there? Since
it's initial inception, PyRIC has grown. PyRIC puts iw, ifconfig, rfkill,
udevadm, airmon-ng and macchanger in your hands (or your program).

### a. Additions to iw
Several "extensions" have been added to iw (See docs/PyRIC.pdf for more
information):
* Persistent sockets: pyw provides the caller with functions & ability to pass
their own netlink (or ioctl socket) to pyw functions;
* One-time request for the nl80211 family id: pyw stores the family id in a
global variable
* Consolidate different "reference" values to wireless NICs in one class
(Cards are tuples t=(dev,phy #,ifindex)

These are minimal changes but they can improve the performance of any progams
that needs to access the wireless nic repeatedly as shown in the table below.

| chset      | Total    | Avg    | Longest   | Shortest |
|------------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Popen(iw)  | 588.3059 | 0.0588 | 0.0682    | 0.0021   |
| one-time   | 560.3559 | 0.0560 | 0.0645    | 0.0003   |
| persistent | 257.8293 | 0.0257 | 0.0354    | 0.0004   |

The table shows benchmarks for hop time on a Alfa AWUS036NH 10000 times. Note that
there is no implication that PyRIC is faster than iw. Rather, the table shows that
PyRIC is faster than using Popen to execute iw. Using one-time sockets, there is
a difference of 28 seconds over Popen and iw with a small decrease in the average
hoptime. Not a big difference. However, the performance increased dramatically when
persistent netlink sockets are used with the total time and average hop time nearly
halved.

### b. Current State
PyRIC is in the process of porting compatibility to Python 3. At present, it will
work on Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. It will also work on Python 3.0 except you
will have to manually enter your devices in the examples (as argparse is not
supported) and you will not be able to run pyw.unittest.py.

ATT, PyRIC provides the following:
* enumerate interfaces and wireless interfaces
* identify a cards driver, chipset and manufacturer
* get/set hardware address
* get/set ip4 address, netmask and or broadcast
* turn card on/off
* get supported standards, commands or modes
* get if info
* get dev info
* get phy info
* get link info
* get STA (connected AP) info
* get/set regulatory domain
* get/set mode
* get/set coverage class, RTS threshold, Fragmentation threshold & retry limits
* add/delete interfaces
* determine if a card is connected
* get link info for a connected card
* enumerate ISM and UNII channels
* block/unblock rfkill devices

In utils, several helpers can be found that can be used to:
* enumerate channels and frequencies and convert between the two
* manipulate mac addresses and generate random ones
* fetch and parse the IEEE oui text file
* further rfkill operations to include listing all rfkill devices

For a full listing of every function offered by pyw and helpers see the user
guide PyRIC.pdf.

PyRIC also provides limited help functionality concerning nl80211 commands/attributes
for those who wish to add additional commands. However, it pulls directly from
the comments nl80211 header file and may be vague.

### c. What is PyRIC?

To avoid confusion, PyRIC is the system as a whole, including all header files
and "libraries" that are required to communicate with the kernel. pyw is a
interface to these libraries providing specific funtions.

What it does - defines programmatic access to a subset of iw, ifconfig and rkill.
In short, PyRIC provides Python wireless pentesters the ability to work with
wireless cards directly from Python without having to use command line tools
through Popen.

## 2. INSTALLING/USING:

### a. Requirements
PyRIC has only two requirements: Linux and Python. There has been very little
testing (on my side) on kernel 4.x and Python 3 but unit testing confirms
functionality on Python 2.7 and kernel 3.13.x.

### b. Install from Package Manager
Obviously, the easiest way to install PyRIC is through PyPI:

    sudo pip install PyRIC

### c. Install from Source
The PyRIC source (tarball) can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyRIC
or http://wraith-wireless.github.io/PyRIC. Additionally, the source, as a zip file,
can be downloaded from https://github.com/wraith-wireless/PyRIC. Once downloaded,
extract the files and from the PyRIC directory run:

    sudo python setup.py install

### d. Test without Installing

If you just want to test PyRIC out, download your choice from above. After extraction,
move the pyric folder (the package directory) to your location of choice and from
there start Python and import pyw. It is very important that you do not try and
run it from PyRIC which is the distribution directory. This will break the imports
pyw uses.

You will only be able to test PyRIC from the pyric directory but, if you want to,
you can add it to your Python path and run it from any program or any location.
To do so, assume you untared PyRIC to /home/bob/PyRIC. Create a text file named
pyric.pth with one line

    /home/bob/PyRIC

and save this file to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (or /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
if you want to try it in Python 3).

### e. Stability vs Latest

Keep in mind that the most stable version and easist installallation but oldest
release is on PyPI (installed through pip). The source on http://wraith-wireless.github.io/PyRIC tends to be
newer but may have some bugs. The most recent source but hardest to install is on
https://github.com/wraith-wireless/pyric/releases/ It is not guaranteed to be stable
(as I tend to commit changes periodically while working on the code) and may in
fact not run at all.

## 3. USING
To use PyRIC, see the examples folder or read throuhg PyRIC.pdf. However, for
those impatient types:

```python
import pyric             # pyric errors
import pyric.pyw as pyw  # iw functionality
```

will import the basic requirements and unless otherwise stated is assumed for the
examples below. It is also assumed that the system is in the US and has three
devices lo, eth0 and wlan0 (only wlan0 of course being wireless). Keep in mind
that these examples use one-time sockets.

Although not all functions require root, we assume that the below have been
executed with root permissions.

Before proceeding with the examples, let's talk about pyric error handling. The
pyric module imports the errorcodes found in the errno module as its own. The 
pyric error subclasses EnvironmentError and all pyric errors are tuples of the 
form t = (error code,error message).

```python
>>> try:
...     #some pyric code
... except pyric.error as e:
...     #handle the error
```

Read the user guide, or type dir(pyw) in your console to get a full listing
of all pyw functions.

The examples below can also be run with named arguments.

### a. System/Wireless Core Functionality
These functions do not work with a specific device rather with the system.

```python
>>> pyw.interfaces() # get all system interfaces
['lo','eth0','wlan']
>>> pyw.isinterface('eth0') # deterimine if eth0 is an interface
True
>>> pyw.isinterface('bob0')
False
>>> pyw.winterfaces() # get all system wireless interfaces
['wlan0']
>>> pyw.isinterface('eth0') # check eth0 for wireless
False
>>> pyw.iswireless('wlan0')
True
>>> pyw.phylist() # list all current phys (Note device ASW phy1)
[(1,'phy1), (0, 'phy0')]
>>> pyw.regget() # get the regulatory domain
'US'
>>> pyw.regset('BO') # set the regulatory domain
True
>>> pyw.regget()
'BO'
>>>
```

### b. Interface Specific
Recall that PyRIC utilizes a Card object - this removes the necessity of having
to remember what to pass each function i.e. whether you have to pass a device name,
physical index or ifindex. Unless otherwise stated, we will be using the card
w0 instantiated as:

```python
>>> w0 = pyw.getcard('wlan0') # get a card for wlan0
>>> w0
Card(phy=0,dev='wlan0',ifindex=2)
```

There are other methods to get a Card object: 
* pyw.devinfo, in addition to information, will return a Card object, 
* pyw.devadd and pyw.phyadd return a card object for the newly created virtual 
interface, and
* pyw.ifaces returns a lists of Cards for every interface sharing the same phy.

It is also important to note while most functions require a Card object, some
do not and some will take a Card or a specific identifier. Read the user
guide or code for additional information.

Before continuing you may find that a Card can become invalid. For example, I
have an older system where the USB tends to fall out. You can confirm that your
card is still valid:

```python
>>> pyw.validcard(w0)
True
>>>
```

#### i. Why is my Card not Working?
Sometimes you may need to turn your Card on, or possibly unblock it.

```python
>>> pyw.isup(w0)
True
>>> pyw.down(w0)
>>> pyw.isup(w0)
False
>>> pyw.up(w0)
>>> pyw.isblocked(w0) # returns tup;e (Soft Block, Hard Block)
(True,False)
>>> pyw.unblock(w0) # turn off the softblock
>>> pyw.isblocked(w0)
(False,False)
>>>
```

#### ii. Working with Mac and IP Addresses

```python
>>> mac = pyw.macget(w0) # get the hw addr
>>> mac
'a0:b1:c2:d3:e4:f5'
>>>
>>> pyw.down(w0): # turn the card off to set the mac
>>> pyw.macset(w0,'00:1F:32:00:01:00') # lets be a nintendo device
>>> pyw.up(w0) # bring wlan0 back up
>>> pyw.macget(w0) # see if it worked
'00:1F:32:00:01:00'
>>>
>>> pyw.inetget(w0) # not associated, inet won't return an address
(None, None, None)
>>> # NOTE: to set the inet, bcast or netmask, the card does not have to be down
...
>>> pyw.inetset(w0,'192.168.3.23','255.255.255.192','192.168.3.63')
True
>>> pyw.inetget(w0)
('192.168.3.23', '255.255.255.192', '192.168.3.255')
>>>
>>> # You can also use ip4set, netmaskset and broadcastset
```

It is important to note that (like ifconfig), erroneous values can be set
when setting the inet addresses: for example you can set the ip address on
192.168.3.* network with a broadcast address of 10.255.255.255.

#### iii. WLAN Radio Properties
You may want to set power management or other radio properties when pentesting.
Particulary, if you are configuring a rogue AP.

```python
>>> pyw.pwrsaveget(w0)
True
>>> pyw.pwrsaveset(w0, False) # turn off powermanagement
>>> pyw.pwrsaveget(w0)
False
>>> pyw.covclassset(w0, 1) # set the coverage class
pyric.error: [Errno 95] Operation not supported
>>> # My internal intel card does not support setting the coverage class
...
>>> pyw.retryshortset(w0, 5)
>>> pyw.retrylongset(w0, 5)
>>> # We'll check these values out shortly
...
>>> pyw.rtsthreshset(w0, 1024)
>>> pyw.fragthreshset(w0, 8000)
>>>
```

For a brief description of coverage class and retry limits,
see http://www.computerhope.com/unix/iwconfig.htm. For a description of the RTS
and Fragmentation thresholds see http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/rts-threshold-configuration-improved-wireless-network-performance/.
The IEEE 802.11-2012 also covers these. 

#### iv. Getting Info On Your Card

```python
>>> iinfo = pyw.ifinfo(w0)
>>> for i in iinfo: print i, iinfo[i]

#### v. Virtual Interfaces
In my experience, virtual interfaces are primarily used to recon, attack or some
other tomfoolery but can also be used to analyze your wireless network. In either
case, it is generally advised to create a virtual monitor interface and delete
all others (on the same phy) - this makes sure that some external process like
NetworkManager does not interfere with your shenanigans. In the below example,
in addition to creating an interface in monitor mode, we find all interfaces
on the same physical index and delete them. You may not need to do this.

NOTE: When creating a device in monitor mode, you can also set flags (see
NL80211_MNTR_FLAGS in nl80211_h), although some cards (usually atheros) do not
always obey these flag requests.

```python
>>> 'monitor' in pyw.devmodes(w0) # make sure we can set wlan0 to monitor
True
>>>
>>> m0 = pyw.devadd(w0,'mon0','monitor') # create mon0 in monitor mode
>>> m0
Card(phy=0,dev=mon0,ifindex=4)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0', 'wlan0']
>>> for card,_ in pyw.ifaces(w0):   # delete all interfaces
...     print card
...     if not card.dev == m0.dev:  # that are not our monitor
...         pyw.devdel(card)        # on the this phy
...
(Card(phy=0,dev=mon0,ifindex=4), 'monitor')
(Card(phy=0,dev=wlan0,ifindex=3), 'managed')
>>>
>>>
>>> pyw.txget(w0)
15
>>> pyw.txset(w0,30,'fixed')
>>> # NOTE: my card does not support setting the tx power.
...
>>> pyw.up(m0) # bring the new card up to use
>>> pyw.chset(m0,6,None) # and set the card to channel 6
True
>>>
```

NOTE: If you don't want to add a virtual interface, you can set the mode of a current
one with modeset.

Once you are done, you will probably want to delete the virtual interface and
restore your original one.

```python
>>> w0 = pyw.devadd(m0,'wlan0','managed') # restore wlan0 in managed mode
>>> pyw.devdel(m0) # delete the monitor interface
True
>>> pyw.up(w0) # and bring the card up
>>>
```

So, perhaps you do not care for the previous method of creating a card
in monitor mode and deleting all associated interfaces and would prefer 
to execute an airmon-ng(ish) method. 

```python
>>> w0
Card(phy=0,dev='wlan0',ifindex=2)
>>> w1 = pyw.devset(w0, 'wlan1')
>>> w1
Card(phy=0,dev=wlan1,ifindex=3)
>>> pyw.modeset(w1, 'monitor')
>>> pyw.up(w1)
>>> pyw.chset(w1, 1, None)
```

The above commands replicate the behaviour of airmon-ng. To verify, open a 
command prompt and execute the following:

```bash
?> iw dev wlan0 info # replace wlan0 with your nic
Interface wlan0
	ifindex 3
	wdev 0x1
	addr a0:88:b4:9e:68:58
	type managed
	wiphy 0
?> sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
Found 2 processes ...
?> 
?> iw dev wlan0mon info 
Interface wlan0mon
	ifindex 6
	wdev 0x2
	addr a0:88:b4:9e:68:58
	type monitor
	wiphy 0
	channel 10 (2457 MHz), width: 20 MHz (no HT), center1: 2457 MHz
?>
?> sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
...
?> iw dev wlan0 info
Interface wlan0
	ifindex 7
	wdev 0x3
	addr a0:88:b4:9e:68:59
	type managed
	wiphy 0
```

As you can see, under the covers, airmon-ng deletes the specified nic 
(wlan0 in this example), creates a new one, sets the mode to monitor and
sets the channel (10 in this case). While the physical index remains the 
same, wiphy 0, the ifindex and wdev change. So, what looks like a simple
renaming of your nic and setting the mode to monitor is in face multiple
steps requiring several communications with the kernel. As stated previously,
I prefer the first method of setting a card to monitor because by 
deleting all associated interfaces, there is a smaller risk of some other
process interfering with you.

If you wanted, you could easily write your own python function to replicate
airmon-ng programmatically. as done below

```python
import pyric
import pyric.pyw as pyw
import pyric.lib.libnl as nl

def pymon(card, start=True, ch=None):
    """
     sets the Card card monitor mode or returns it to managed mode
     :param card: a Card object
     :param start: True = set|False = reset
     :param ch: initial ch to start on
     :returns: the new card
    """
    newcard = None
    if start:
        if pyw.modeget(card) == 'monitor':
            raise RuntimeError("Card is already in monitor mode")
        newcard = pyw.devset(card, card.dev + 'mon')
        pyw.modeset(newcard, 'monitor')       
        pyw.up(newcard)
        if ch: pyw.chset(w1, ch, None) 
    else:
        if pyw.modeget(card) == 'managed':
            raise RuntimeError("Card is not in monitor mode")
        newcard = pyw.devset(card, card.dev[:-3])
        pyw.modeset(newcard, 'managed')        
        pyw.up(newcard)
    return newcard
```

##### o Virtual Interfaces and Issues in Kernel 4.x 
After recently upgrading my distro, my kernel was upgraded from 3.x to 4.x. I 
noticed that in some situations, adding a virtual interface (VIF) did not have 
the desired effect. Namely, new VIFs did not have the dev name I had specified.
Furthermore, regardless of the naming convention I was currently using (old 
school like wlan0, eth0 etc or the newer predictable names i.e. wlp3s0) the
new VIF would have a predictable name and the MAC address would be one up from 
that of the actual cards MAC address. For more details, check out my blog 
at https://wraithwireless.wordpress.com/2016/07/24/linux-kernel-bug/. This is
an issue at the kernel and nl80211 level and not a PyRIC bug.

This situtation will only occur if you are attempting to (a) create a VIF with
the same dev name as the original, (b) in managed mode and (c) there are currently
other VIFs sharing the same phy. 

```python
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['alfa0']
>>> card = pyw.getcard('alfa0')
>>> card
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=5)
>>> mcard
Card(phy=1,dev=mon0,ifindex=6)
>>> pyw.devdel(card)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0']
>>> pyw.devadd(mcard,'alfa0','managed')
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=7)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0', 'wlx00c0ca59afa7']
>>> pyw.devdel(pyw.getcard('wlx00c0ca59afa7'))
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['wlan0mon', 'mon0']
>>> pyw.phyadd(mcard,'alfa0','managed')
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=8)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['wlan0mon', 'mon0', 'wlx00c0ca59afa7']
```

All three of the above most be True for this to occur. So, for example:

```python
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0']
>>> pyw.devadd(mcard,'alfa0','monitor')
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=10)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0', 'alfa0']
```

works because case (b) is false.

Some things to note:
* it does not matter if you are using devadd (creating a VIF via the ifindex) or
phyadd (creating a VIF via the physical index)
* nl80211 believes that new VIF has the name you specified so I believe this is
something related to the kernel itself or possibly udev. If you look at the source
code for phyadd or devadd, the returned card uses the indicators returned by the
kernel.

I had considered several options of rectifying this for PyRIC but, doing so would
require either mutliple checks on kernel version or breaking backward compatibility
for users with kernel 3.x and possibly breaking forward compatibility (if this 
issue does get fixed at some future kernel version). Besides, being aware of 
the state that must be true for this to happen, users can easily workaround it.

One way, as we saw earlier, is to create a VIF in monitor mode and then set it 
to managed.

```python
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0']
>>> pyw.devadd(mcard,'alfa0','monitor')
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=10)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0', 'alfa0']
>>> pyw.devdel(pyw.getcard('mon0'))
>>> card = pyw.getcard('alfa0')
>>> pyw.down(card)
>>> pyw.modeset(card,'managed')
>>> pyw.up
<function up at 0x7f76339c99b0>
>>> pyw.up()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: up() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)
>>> pyw.up(card)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['wlan0mon', 'alfa0']
>>> pyw.devinfo(card)
{'wdev': 4294967302, 'RF': None, 'CF': None, 'mac': '00:c0:ca:59:af:a6', 
'mode': 'managed', 'CHW': None, 'card': Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=10)}
```

But, I think this is sloppy. The better way is to use phyadd. Recall that 
phyadd accepts either a Card or the phy and that even though a card is deleted,
some of its reference values are still valid. In the case of deleting a card,
the phy is still present. So, you could use a phy or a Card that was previously
deleted because the phy is still valid. 

```python
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['mon0']
>>> phy = mcard.phy
>>> pyw.devdel(mcard)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
[]
>>> card = pyw.phyadd(phy,'alfa0','managed')
>>> card
Card(phy=1,dev=alfa0,ifindex=12)
>>> pyw.winterfaces()
['alfa0']
```

This works, but remember you have to delete all interfaces with the same phy
as the one you are creating before creating it.

#### vi. STA Related Functions
I have recently begun adding STA functionality to PyRIC. These are not necessarily 
required for a pentester, although the ability to disconnect a Card may come in 
handy. The difficulty is that iw only provides connect functionality through Open
or WEP enabled APs which means that I am attempting to determine which commands 
and attributes are required. If all else fails I will look to wpa_supplicant for 
more information. Additionally, iw will not connect if wpa_supplicant is running.

```python
>>> pyw.isconnected(w0)
True
>>> pyw.disconnect(w0)
>>> pyw.isconnected(w0)
False
>>>
```

From a pentester's point of view iw link provides information of limited
quality/concern but can be useful at times. As such, link has now been
implemented. 

```python
>>> link=pyw.link(w0)
>>> for d in link:
...     print d, link[d]
... 
stat associated
ssid ****net
bssid XX:YY:ZZ:00:11:22
chw 20
int 100
freq 5765
tx {'pkts': 256, 'failed': 0, 'bytes': 22969, 'bitrate': {'rate': 6.0}, 
    'retries': 31}
rx {'pkts': 29634, 'bitrate': {'width': 40, 'rate': 270.0, 
    'mcs-index': 14, 'gi': 0}, 'bytes': 2365454}
rss -50
>>>
```

NOTE: the rx gives additional key->value pairs for bitrate. Depending on
whether the Card is transmitting (or receiving) 802.11n, the bitrate may
include values for width, mcs-index and guard interval (gi). If we look
up these values in Table 20-35 of IEEE Std 802.11-2012, we see that at 
40 MHz width, an mcs-index of 14 with a short guard interval (400ns)
the rate = 270.

One can also use pyw.stainfo to retrieve only tx/rx metrics.

#### vii. Miscelleaneous Utilities
Several additional tools are located in the utils directory. Two of these are:
 * channels.py: defines ISM and UNII band channels/frequencies and provides
 functions to convert between channel and frequency and vice-versa
 * ouifetch.py: retrieves and parses oui.txt from the IEEE website and stores
  the oui data in a file that can be read by hardware.py functions
The others will be demonstrated in the following

hardware.py
Driver, chipset and mac address related functions can be found here:

``` python
import pyric.utils.hardware as hw

ouis = hw.parseoui() # load the oui dict
len(ouis)
=> 22128

mac = 'a0:88:b4:9e:68:58'
dev = 'wlan0'

hw.oui(mac)
=> 'a0:88:b4'

hw.ulm(mac)
=> '9e:68:58'

hw.manufacturer(ouis,mac)
=> 'Intel Corporate'

hw.randhw(ouis) # generate a random mac address
=>'00:03:f0:5a:a1:fc'

hw.manufacturer(ouis,'00:03:f0:5a:a1:fc')
=> 'Redfern Broadband Networks'

hw.ifcard(dev) # get driver & chipset
=> ('iwlwifi', 'Intel 4965/5xxx/6xxx/1xxx')
```

rfkill.py
Sometimes, your card has a soft block (or hard block) on it and it is not
recognized by command line tools or pyw. Use rkill to list, turn on or turn
off soft blocks.

``` python
import pyric.utils.rfkill as rfkill

rfkill.rfkill_list() # list rfkill devices
=> {'tpacpi_bluetooth_sw': {'soft': True, 'hard': False, 'type': 'bluetooth', 'idx': 1},
    'phy3': {'soft': False, 'hard': False, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 5},
    'phy0': {'soft': False, 'hard': False, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 0}}

idx = rfkill.getidx(3)
idx
=> 5

rfkill.getname(idx)
=> phy3

rfkill.gettype(idx)
=> 'wlan'

rfkill.soft_blocked(idx)
=> False

rfkill.hard_blocked(idx)
=> False

rfkill.rfkill_block(idx)

rfkill.list()
=> {'tpacpi_bluetooth_sw': {'soft': False, 'hard': True, 'type': 'bluetooth', 'idx': 1},
    'phy3': {'soft': True, 'hard': True, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 5},
    'phy0': {'soft': True, 'hard': True, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 0}}

rfkill.rfkill_unblock(idx)

rfkill.rfkill_list()
=> {'tpacpi_bluetooth_sw': {'soft': True, 'hard': False, 'type': 'bluetooth', 'idx': 1},
    'phy3': {'soft': False, 'hard': False, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 5},
    'phy0': {'soft': False, 'hard': False, 'type': 'wlan', 'idx': 0}}
```

Note that rfkill_list lists all 'wireless' devices: wlan, bluetooth, wimax, wwan,
gps, fm and nfc. Another important thing to note is that the rfkill index is not
the same as the interface index.
